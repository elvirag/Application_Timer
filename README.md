<h2>To install:</h2></br>

First of all, this requires python 3 to be installed, so go ahead and install python 3, if you didn't.</br></br>
Then, use [this link](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/),
till you get to the part of "[Installing Packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-packages)".</br>
Inside the directory, run:</br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Now you need to setup the daemon for scheduling.


Alternate way (to be updated in the future):
run install.bat
